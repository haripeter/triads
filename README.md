This is an algorithm that reveal the frequency of triad formation in a network.

The input matrix format:

	A	B	C
A	0	1	1
B	0	0	1
C	0	0	0

The matrix above illustrates the triad formation.

1. create a matrix (with .txt extension)
2. set the folder to file variable
3. get the frequency of triad formations
